This is a site which crawls cowbei data from [靠北交大](https://www.facebook.com/CowBeiNCTU/).
Since posts from the page are not public, I have to crawl all them down instead of using Facebook API directly.
To make the page load faster, I only show 200 highest rank posts, but all posts that have likes >24 are crawled and stored in cowbei.csv.

Have fun! And I have to get my dinner LOL
